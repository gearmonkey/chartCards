A project to script the creation of guerilla marketing moo cards for musicmetric.
Each card will feature a sparkline (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline) of a trending artist on one side and a QR code to that trending artist's page on the other, possibly with a shorten url. 

The goal is to make cards for 100 different artists in a given pack.

Will used the MOO api (http://uk.moo.com/api/) to make the cards, the musicmetric API (http://developer.musicmetric.com) for charts and a to be determined libraries for QR codes and short urls.
